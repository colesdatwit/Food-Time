# Food-Time

Introduction:
Approximately 40% of Americans in 2024 expressed an interest in learning a new language. However, achieving this goal can be challenging due to the time commitment required and the difficulty and potential monotony of language learning. To address this, we aim to create an educational game called Food Time. In this game, players will act as chefs in a kitchen, preparing and delivering food orders. Initially, orders will be in English, but as players progress, orders will incorporate different languages, helping players learn new languages in an engaging and interactive way
